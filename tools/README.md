The files in this directory should not be considered a part of the agent implmementation, rather 
are metaphorically a set of tools that are made available to the agent at runtime. This is 
reminiscent of registering MCP tools with something like Claude Desktop or Cursor. In this sample
we have not implemented that tool registry and have instead isolated the tool registry into this
separate set of files.

Note that the agentic loop calls an activity by the name of the tool selected by the LLM and this
activity invocation is handled by the tool_invoker dynamic activity.
